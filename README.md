## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS reset
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This project gave me some practice with using and understanding the CSS reset which I've linked below. Additionally, I tried to be more aware of not declaring things which I did not need to, such as assigning width 100% where it wasnt needed. I learned that setting a max-width of 100% to images can help to prevent them from overflowing their containers.

### Continued development

For continued development I would try and make the media query section more DRY.

### Useful resources

- [CSS Reset](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/css/custom-css-reset/) - I found this helpful resource for making layouts easier to manage.
